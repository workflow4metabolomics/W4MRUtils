Description: Provides a set of utility function to prevent the spread of
    utilities script in W4M (Workflow For Metabolomics) scripts, and centralize
    them in a single package.
    Some are meant to be replaced by real packages in a near future, like
    the parse_args() function: it is here only to prepare the ground for
    more global changes in W4M scripts and tools.
